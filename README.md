# Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) 
## Introduction
### Overview
Early childhood education plays a pivotal role in shaping a child's academic trajectory and overall development. Understanding the factors that influence students' educational experiences is of paramount importance for educators and researchers alike. The present study utilizes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to delve into the relationship between family types and students' reading levels. 
By investigating this association, we aim to shed light on how different family structures may impact students' reading proficiency, particularly if they are reading below grade level. This study leverages statistical analyses to explore potential connections and draw meaningful insights that could inform early childhood education practices and policies.

The purpose of the ECLS-K dataset is to explore the associations between various factors, including family, school, community, and individual factors, with school performance. The data is collected longitudinally, tracking students from kindergarten through 8th grade, allowing researchers to gain insights into the factors influencing students' educational journey.

# The Relationship Between Individual and Social Background Characteristics and Educational Outcomes
## Introduction
### Overview
One of the most crucial areas of educational research is the connection between personal and societal traits and secondary school student's academic performance. In the context of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is run by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, has received extensive research (OECD). In particular, the PISA study has examined how factors such as gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and immigration status affect educational outcomes like academic achievement and school involvement (John et al., 2018). The PISA study's results have shed important light on the many variables that affect secondary school pupils' academic success. For instance, the study has emphasized the significance of giving disadvantaged students, such as those from minority backgrounds, support to ensure their access to a high-quality education on an equal basis (Wilmers & Jornitz, 2021). Furthermore, the PISA study's results have been crucial in guiding the development of public policies that support social justice and educational equity (John et al., 2018).
However, this study aims to explore the various relationship between individuals and their social background characteristics, including the educational outcomes of secondary school students, using the PISA 2015 dataset. The main research questions of this study are to determine to what extent the individual and social background characteristics of secondary school students influence their educational outcomes and how various factors moderate this effect?, how does the relationship between parental income level and educational attainment of secondary school students vary by country of residence?. The primary contribution of this particular study to the literature is to provide further insight into the influence of personal and social background characteristics on educational outcomes and to understand the moderating role of various factors. This research is essential to gain a comprehensive and better understanding of the factors that lead to educational success so that interventions can be developed to help students achieve their educational goals (MacKinnon, 2012). 
Rationale: Previous research has found that parental income level is an important factor in determining educational outcomes, and that socio-economic status can vary greatly between countries. This research question seeks to explore how the relationship between parental income level and educational attainment of secondary school students is affected by the country in which they reside.
The hypotheses of this study are as follows: H1: There is a positive relationship between the amount of time students spend on extracurricular activities, the relationship between personal and social background characteristics and educational outcomes of secondary school students, and their academic achievement in mathematics. H2: The effect of the amount of time students spend on extracurricular activities on their academic achievement in mathematics is more significant for students from low-income backgrounds than for those from high-income backgrounds. 
Various factors will moderate the relationship between personal and social background characteristics and secondary school students' educational outcomes (Kremelberg, 2010). This study's independent variable is secondary school students' individual and social background characteristics. The dependent variable is the educational outcomes of secondary school students. The moderator variables are some of the various factors that may influence the relationship between the dependent variables and independent data variables (Pallant, 2020).




# Coefficient of Correlation research
## Introduction
### Overview

A correlation coefficient is a statistical indicator of how strongly and in what direction two variables are related (Field, 2013). It gauges how closely two variables are related to one another. It can quantify either the non-linear or linear relationship between two variables. It is represented by a number ranging from -1 to 1. The linear relationship between the two variables is stronger when the correlation coefficient is close to 1, and the negative linear relationship is stronger when it is close to -1. There is no association between the two variables if the correlation coefficient is 0. (Asuero et al., 2006).
However, both positive and negative correlations are included in the coefficient correlation. A statistical metric known as a positive correlation coefficient indicates a direct association between two variables in this context. Accordingly, as one variable rises, the other rises, and vice versa. A correlation value of 0.8, for instance, indicates that when one variable grows by one unit, the other variable will likewise increase by 0.8 units. The spss analysis takes this into account (Asuero et al., 2006)
In this concept, Positive correlation coefficients are used to identify relationships between variables in a range of scientific fields of psychology. A positive correlation coefficient can be used to measure the interaction between different personality traits. In addition, positive correlation coefficients can also be identified through other ways, such as regression analysis, which is fitting a line through data points to identify the relationship between two variables. The result of this analysis is an equation that can be used to predict the value of one variable given the value of the other.
A positive correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that identifies the relationship between two variables. It can identify relationships in various scientific fields and is typically found through regression analysis. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship between the two variables.
A negative correlation in psychology refers to a relationship between two variables in which an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. It is the opposite of a positive correlation. Examples of negative correlations include higher levels of stress being associated with lower levels of job satisfaction, increased levels of anxiety being associated with decreased performance on tests, and higher levels of depression is associated with lower levels of self-esteem.

# Comparing Means, samples t-tests, and P-values in SPSS
## Introduction
### Overview
In many situations, you will wish to compare the means, samples t-tests, and p-values of two populations or samples in statistics. The method one employs to calculate and compare the mean relies on the kind of data an individual has and how it is organized. A statistical test t-test is used to compare the means of the two groups. It frequently appears in hypothesis testing. While the P-value calculates the likelihood of getting outcomes observed, presuming that the null hypothesis is correct ( Park,2019).
1a) Compare Means function on the Body Image and Self Esteem variables



#### 1b) The differences in means comparisons
Using the compare means function between the Body Image and Self Esteem variables on the Food Consumption SPSS data set. Body Image is placed as the independent variable, while the Self Esteem as the dependent variable for analysis. Among the total N=30 Samples, cases included were 30 samples translated to 1000%, while the cases excluded were zero 0.
From the total 30 samples, the least average was 15.0000, and the highest mean average was 26.6667. Secondly, the lowest body image, 29.00, has a mean value of 22.0000, while the highest Body Image variable, 48.00, has an average mean value of 22.9333. There were nearly the same mean average among the 32.00, 35.00, and 47.00 Body Image variables. The 32.00 and 47.00 Body Image variables have the same mean average values. The standard deviations within the Body Image variables are not relatively close (Liang,2019). Finally, among the total samples, the difference in mean or average of the total 30 samples  (n = 30) was just about 2.0000. 
2a) (i) Independent samples t-tests between Dieting Status and Body Image variables
Body image is the test variable, while Dieting status is the grouping variable.



#### 2a) (ii) Independent samples t-tests between Dieting Status and Self-Esteem variables
Self-esteem is the test Variable, while Dieting Status is the grouping Variable. 



#### 2b)(i) P-values and the relationship between Dieting status and Body image

The test is significant since the p-value of 0.016 (p=0.016) is less than the 0.05 two-tailed significant level; thus, there is a significant relationship between the Dieting status and the Body Image variables.  
#### 2b)(ii) P-values and the relationship between Dieting Status and Self-esteem


	The p-value of 0.098 (p=0.098) suggests that the test is insignificant. This is because the p-value obtained is greater than the 0.05 two-tailed significant level; thus, there is no significant relationship between the Dieting Status and Self-esteem variables.
#### 3a) Means for Consumption1, Consumption2, Mood1, and Mood2


3b) How scores on Consumption and Mood changed from Time 1 to Time 2
Using a new variable named TotalMeanScore, the means of the Consumption1, Consumption2, Mood1, and Mood2 variables are computed, and the mean score for Consumption and Mood is found to have slightly increased from the first Time 1 session to the second session Time 2 in both cases.
#### 3c) Dependent samples t-tests on the Consumption variables and the Mood variables
##### 3c)(i) Dependent samples t-tests on the Consumption1 and  Mood1 variables



##### 3c)(ii) Dependent samples t-tests on the Consumption2 and  Mood2 variables



#### 3d) P-values on the Consumption and Mood variables and conclusion about the changes in consumption and mood.
##### 3d(i) P-value of Consumption1 and Mood1

The p-value of 0.337(p=0.337) suggests that the test is insignificant. This is because the p-value obtained is greater than the 0.05 two-tailed significant level; thus, there is no significant relationship between the Consumption1 and Mood1 variables.
##### 3d(ii P-value of Consumption2 and Mood2

Also, in the second case, the p-value of 0.845 (p=0.845) suggests that the test is insignificant. This is because the p-value is greater than the 0.05 two-tailed significant level; thus, there is no significant relationship between the Consumption2 and Mood2 variables.
In conclusion, the p-value between consumption and mood variables increased from 0.337 to 0.845 in the two sessions amongst the 30 participants.
#### 4a) Research hypothesis (unrelated to the Food Consumption dataset)
A research hypothesis is assessed using a dependent samples t-test on a hypothetical data set containing the height and weight of 10 individuals. The heights and weights Variables are used as independent variables, and the entry values as the dependent variables for both cases.
#### 4b) Dependent samples t-test on the hypothesis data in SPSS




#### 4c) Description of the research hypothesis and support from the hypothetical data
From the hypothetical data containing the height and weight Variables, it is noted that the dependent t-test can look for "differences" between means when the 10 participants are measured on the same dependent variable under different conditions, thereby supporting the research hypothesis. In addition, the one-sided p-value of 0.012 (p=0.012) and the two-sided p-value of  0.024(p=0.024) are less than the 0.05 two-tailed significant level suggesting the test is significant; thus, there is a significant relationship between the height and the weight variables (Cleophas et al.,2010).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Compare Means procedure might be helpful when comparing variations in descriptive statistics across one or more factors or categorical variables. In addition, two tables will be produced by the Compare Means procedures: the Case Processing Summary, which includes details about the number of valid cases used to generate the statistics, and the Report table, which includes the descriptive statistics themselves (Plonsky,2015). Therefore when comparing multiple numerical variables to one or more categorical variables, Compare Means is the method of choice even when summarizing numerical variables simultaneously across categories; it is helpful (Orcan,2020).
