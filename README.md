# Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K)
## Introduction
### Overview
Early childhood education plays a pivotal role in shaping a child's academic trajectory and overall development. Understanding the factors that influence students' educational experiences is of paramount importance for educators and researchers alike. The present study utilizes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to delve into the relationship between family types and students' reading levels. 
By investigating this association, we aim to shed light on how different family structures may impact students' reading proficiency, particularly if they are reading below grade level. This study leverages statistical analyses to explore potential connections and draw meaningful insights that could inform early childhood education practices and policies.
Brief background summary of the dataset its purpose
The dataset used for this assignment is derived from the online codebook titled "Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K)." This dataset is valuable for understanding early childhood educational experiences and their impacts. 
The purpose of the ECLS-K dataset is to explore the associations between various factors, including family, school, community, and individual factors, with school performance. The data is collected longitudinally, tracking students from kindergarten through 8th grade, allowing researchers to gain insights into the factors influencing students' educational journey.

# The Relationship Between Individual and Social Background Characteristics and Educational Outcomes
## Introduction
### Overview
One of the most crucial areas of educational research is the connection between personal and societal traits and secondary school student's academic performance. In the context of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is run by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, has received extensive research (OECD). In particular, the PISA study has examined how factors such as gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and immigration status affect educational outcomes like academic achievement and school involvement (John et al., 2018). The PISA study's results have shed important light on the many variables that affect secondary school pupils' academic success. For instance, the study has emphasized the significance of giving disadvantaged students, such as those from minority backgrounds, support to ensure their access to a high-quality education on an equal basis (Wilmers & Jornitz, 2021). Furthermore, the PISA study's results have been crucial in guiding the development of public policies that support social justice and educational equity (John et al., 2018).
However, this study aims to explore the various relationship between individuals and their social background characteristics, including the educational outcomes of secondary school students, using the PISA 2015 dataset. The main research questions of this study are to determine to what extent the individual and social background characteristics of secondary school students influence their educational outcomes and how various factors moderate this effect?, how does the relationship between parental income level and educational attainment of secondary school students vary by country of residence?. The primary contribution of this particular study to the literature is to provide further insight into the influence of personal and social background characteristics on educational outcomes and to understand the moderating role of various factors. This research is essential to gain a comprehensive and better understanding of the factors that lead to educational success so that interventions can be developed to help students achieve their educational goals (MacKinnon, 2012). 
Rationale: Previous research has found that parental income level is an important factor in determining educational outcomes, and that socio-economic status can vary greatly between countries. This research question seeks to explore how the relationship between parental income level and educational attainment of secondary school students is affected by the country in which they reside.
The hypotheses of this study are as follows: H1: There is a positive relationship between the amount of time students spend on extracurricular activities, the relationship between personal and social background characteristics and educational outcomes of secondary school students, and their academic achievement in mathematics. H2: The effect of the amount of time students spend on extracurricular activities on their academic achievement in mathematics is more significant for students from low-income backgrounds than for those from high-income backgrounds. 
Various factors will moderate the relationship between personal and social background characteristics and secondary school students' educational outcomes (Kremelberg, 2010). This study's independent variable is secondary school students' individual and social background characteristics. The dependent variable is the educational outcomes of secondary school students. The moderator variables are some of the various factors that may influence the relationship between the dependent variables and independent data variables (Pallant, 2020).




# Coefficient of Correlation research
## Introduction
### Overview

A correlation coefficient is a statistical indicator of how strongly and in what direction two variables are related (Field, 2013). It gauges how closely two variables are related to one another. It can quantify either the non-linear or linear relationship between two variables. It is represented by a number ranging from -1 to 1. The linear relationship between the two variables is stronger when the correlation coefficient is close to 1, and the negative linear relationship is stronger when it is close to -1. There is no association between the two variables if the correlation coefficient is 0. (Asuero et al., 2006).
However, both positive and negative correlations are included in the coefficient correlation. A statistical metric known as a positive correlation coefficient indicates a direct association between two variables in this context. Accordingly, as one variable rises, the other rises, and vice versa. A correlation value of 0.8, for instance, indicates that when one variable grows by one unit, the other variable will likewise increase by 0.8 units. The spss analysis takes this into account (Asuero et al., 2006)
In this concept, Positive correlation coefficients are used to identify relationships between variables in a range of scientific fields of psychology. A positive correlation coefficient can be used to measure the interaction between different personality traits. In addition, positive correlation coefficients can also be identified through other ways, such as regression analysis, which is fitting a line through data points to identify the relationship between two variables. The result of this analysis is an equation that can be used to predict the value of one variable given the value of the other.
A positive correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that identifies the relationship between two variables. It can identify relationships in various scientific fields and is typically found through regression analysis. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship between the two variables.
A negative correlation in psychology refers to a relationship between two variables in which an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. It is the opposite of a positive correlation. Examples of negative correlations include higher levels of stress being associated with lower levels of job satisfaction, increased levels of anxiety being associated with decreased performance on tests, and higher levels of depression is associated with lower levels of self-esteem.
